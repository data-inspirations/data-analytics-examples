# data-analytics-examples

This repository contains examples referenced in various posts at https://blog.datainspirations.com. 

The series of posts begins with a compilation of data obtained from https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1 (Â© NHL 2018) as JSON documents which in turn is converted to a set of Microsoft Power BI tables. These tables form a data model from which a variety of analytical visualizations are derived. 


More to come.
